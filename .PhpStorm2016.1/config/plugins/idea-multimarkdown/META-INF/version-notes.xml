            <h3>1.4.3 - Bug Fix &amp; Improvements Release</h3>

                <li>Change: vcs roots are now obtained from the IDE and not by scanning for git configuration in the file system. So if   the VCS root is not defined in the IDE the plugin will not be able to resolve links for that GitHub repository.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Enhanced Edition</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix: #143, In wiki link completions file names that contain <code>#</code> are truncated with <code>#</code> in the file treated as an   anchor ref</li>
                <li>Fix: #144, Annotation for wiki links with <code>#</code> in filename not shown</li>
                <li>Fix: #145, Wiki link refactoring not working for file names containing <code>#</code></li>

                <li>Add: #147, GitHub issue # completions in plain text and for links. In text after <code>#</code>, for links after <code>/issues/</code>, the   cursor must be after a valid issues link for the current file's github repository and come after the last <code>/</code>.
                    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For this to work correctly you need to enable "ATX Header Space" option in the parser otherwise a <code>#</code> followed by non-space text is parsed as a header and not a github issue.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Add: link completions now display shortened file path in completion list. The addressing format is controllable via   multiple invocations of the completion popup. If the link does not start with a protocol prefix nor a <code>/</code> for repo   relative addressing then pressing ctrl+space will cycle through all possible formats configured in preferences under   Completions, by default: relative addressing, <code>/</code> repo relative, <code>https://</code> absolute. With <code>file://</code> addressing   completions only if the link starts with <code>file://</code> before pressing ctrl+space or by changing preferences to include   file:// protocol in completion format cycle.</li>
                <li>Add: code folding for multi-line image urls</li>
                <li>Add: collapsed by default config under settings <strong>Editor</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Code Folding</strong>, for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>verbatim blocks</li>

                        <li>multi-line URL images</li>
                        <li>references</li>
                        <li>explicit links</li>
                        <li>explicit image links</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Fix: ANCHORLINKS parser option only affects unmodified HTML text preview and should not be changed by parser profile   changes.</li>
                <li>Fix: unmodified HTML text preview should not generate header tag ids if ANCHORLINKS parser option is not selected.</li>
                <li>Fix: multi-line url images with <code>http://gravizo?</code>
                    <ul>
                        <li>prefix were adding <code>;</code> after <code>{</code></li>
                        <li>all trailing <code>;</code> are removed, not just one when editing injected code fragment</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Add: view document on GitHub option when file is under vcs and is not modified. No checking is done if changes were   actually pushed to the remote branch.</li>
                <li>Change: color attributes that previously contained <code>BOLDITALIC</code> are now <code>BOLD_ITALIC</code> to match the naming convention   of other attributes.</li>
                <li>Change: page relative and repo relative links in preview resolve to file in current remote branch with fallback to   <code>master</code> if current branch has no remote counterpart. Previously they always resolved to <code>master</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.4.2 - Bug Fix &amp; Improvements Release</h3>
            <h4>Basic &amp; Enhanced Editions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix: disable spell checker on reference anchors</li>
                <li>Fix: mitigate pegdown parser timeouts by treating the whole text as error with preview showing the pegdown exception   with some information on the location where it gave up.</li>
                <li>Fix: #142, reduced max timeout to 1000 ms, and default to 100ms. No point in longer timeouts, just harder to edit the   text to eliminate the error.</li>
                <li>Fix: removed native thread creation in preview tabs, should be the last of the leftover old code.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Enhanced Edition</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix: #138, reference with title refactoring causes exception due to single quote use for title instead of double quote</li>
                <li>Add: #139, completions for reference and footnote id will show all unresolved corresponding referencing ids in the   file</li>
                <li>Add: #140, under some conditions unresolved links would not be highlighted as such</li>
                <li>Change: for image alt text completion remove subdirectories matching: "image", "images", "img" and "imgs" from parts   used to make suggestions</li>
                <li>Change: for all link text/title suggestions remove subdirectory parts which match file target GitHub links: blob, raw,   wiki from directory parts before generating suggestion</li>
                <li>Fix: language fragment editor would not be resizeable if more than one split editor is open with JavaFx preview   enabled.</li>
                <li>Change: previous releases did not reset show preview tab when the license was activated for the first time, resulting   in many people having preview tab shown by default and not noticing it. This version does a one time reset of this   setting. If you really want a preview tab with split editor then just set it again in preferences to have it shown.   Only affects files opened after the setting is changed. So you may need to reopen files already opened when you change   this setting.</li>
                <li>New: implement file move refactoring for contained links. If the contained wiki links will no longer reach their   targets they are changed to explicit links.</li>
                <li>Fix: refactoring of links to wiki pages, from files nested below root directory would leave the physical wiki home   directory instead of changing it to <code>wiki</code> as required to resolve on GitHub.</li>
                <li>Fix: refactoring explicit to wiki link would leave the markdown extension in the wiki. Extensions are now left only if   target is not a markdown file.</li>
                <li>New: raw/blob preservation across wiki/main repo boundary during file move. Best attempt is made to preserve raw file   access of original link</li>
                <li>New: intention actions implemented instead of annotation quick fixes. Same functionality but no unnecessary weak   warnings just to have the quick fix showing and now they can be disabled individually if you don't need them.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.4.1 - Bug Fix Release</h3>

                <li>Add: #137, refactoring explicit link and explicit image to implicit reference will add dummy reference to avoid the   next element from being interpreted as the reference key for the newly inserted element.</li>
                <li>Fix: #134, rename refactoring atx header inserted a line break after atx marker</li>
                <li>Fix: #135, references to files with image extension now only offer to convert to raw target URL</li>

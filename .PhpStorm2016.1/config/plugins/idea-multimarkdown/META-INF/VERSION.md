  characters.
- Fix: #184, Smooth scroll issues with preview. Reduce frequency of on scroll callbacks to reduce delay during
  scrolling.
- Fix: #185, IntelliJ IDEA performance is heavily affected by this plug-in. Pegdown bug causes exponential parse time
  for markdown with unclosed HTML tags and fenced code blocks that contain HTML.

#### Enhanced Edition

* Add: parsing of HTML anchor elements with id for resolving, annotating duplicates and finding usages for ref anchors.
  Only the opening tag is significant: `<a id='ref-anchor'>` or `<a id="ref-anchor">`
* Change: anchor ref completion shows header level and text, for ref anchors shows complete opening tag
* Fix: optimizations that skip reformatting to be less optimistic improving wrap on typing results.

- Fix: #149, Out of memory errors possibly caused by parser throwing an exception during indexing
- Change: vcs roots are now obtained from the IDE and not by scanning for git configuration in the file system. So if
  the VCS root is not defined in the IDE the plugin will not be able to resolve links for that GitHub repository.

#### Enhanced Edition

* Fix: #143, In wiki link completions file names that contain `#` are truncated with `#` in the file treated as an
  anchor ref
* Fix: #144, Annotation for wiki links with `#` in filename not shown
* Fix: #145, Wiki link refactoring not working for file names containing `#`
* Fix: #146, File names that contain # do not show link references with URL encoded link address.
* Add: #147, GitHub issue # completions in plain text and for links. In text after `#`, for links after `/issues/`, the
  cursor must be after a valid issues link for the current file's github repository and come after the last `/`.

    **NOTE:** For this to work correctly you need to enable "ATX Header Space" option in the parser otherwise a `#`
    followed by non-space text is parsed as a header and not a github issue.
* Add: link completions now display shortened file path in completion list. The addressing format is controllable via
  multiple invocations of the completion popup. If the link does not start with a protocol prefix nor a `/` for repo
  relative addressing then pressing ctrl+space will cycle through all possible formats configured in preferences under
  Completions, by default: relative addressing, `/` repo relative, `https://` absolute. With `file://` addressing
  completions only if the link starts with `file://` before pressing ctrl+space or by changing preferences to include
  file:// protocol in completion format cycle.
* Add: code folding for multi-line image urls
* Add: collapsed by default config under settings **Editor** > **General** > **Code Folding**, for:
    * verbatim blocks
    * code fence blocks
    * multi-line URL images
    * references
    * explicit links
    * explicit image links
* Fix: ANCHORLINKS parser option only affects unmodified HTML text preview and should not be changed by parser profile
  changes.
* Fix: unmodified HTML text preview should not generate header tag ids if ANCHORLINKS parser option is not selected.
* Fix: multi-line url images with `http://gravizo?`
    * prefix were adding `;` after `{`
    * all trailing `;` are removed, not just one when editing injected code fragment
* Add: view document on GitHub option when file is under vcs and is not modified. No checking is done if changes were
  actually pushed to the remote branch.
* Change: color attributes that previously contained `BOLDITALIC` are now `BOLD_ITALIC` to match the naming convention
  of other attributes.
* Change: page relative and repo relative links in preview resolve to file in current remote branch with fallback to
  `master` if current branch has no remote counterpart. Previously they always resolved to `master`.

### 1.4.2 - Bug Fix & Improvements Release

#### Basic & Enhanced Editions

- Fix: disable spell checker on reference anchors
- Fix: mitigate pegdown parser timeouts by treating the whole text as error with preview showing the pegdown exception
  with some information on the location where it gave up.
- Fix: #142, reduced max timeout to 1000 ms, and default to 100ms. No point in longer timeouts, just harder to edit the
  text to eliminate the error.
- Fix: removed native thread creation in preview tabs, should be the last of the leftover old code.

#### Enhanced Edition

* Fix: #138, reference with title refactoring causes exception due to single quote use for title instead of double quote
* Add: #139, completions for reference and footnote id will show all unresolved corresponding referencing ids in the
  file
* Add: #140, under some conditions unresolved links would not be highlighted as such
* Change: for image alt text completion remove subdirectories matching: "image", "images", "img" and "imgs" from parts
  used to make suggestions
* Change: for all link text/title suggestions remove subdirectory parts which match file target GitHub links: blob, raw,
  wiki from directory parts before generating suggestion
* Fix: language fragment editor would not be resizeable if more than one split editor is open with JavaFx preview
  enabled.
* Change: previous releases did not reset show preview tab when the license was activated for the first time, resulting
  in many people having preview tab shown by default and not noticing it. This version does a one time reset of this
  setting. If you really want a preview tab with split editor then just set it again in preferences to have it shown.
  Only affects files opened after the setting is changed. So you may need to reopen files already opened when you change
  this setting.
* New: implement file move refactoring for contained links. If the contained wiki links will no longer reach their
  targets they are changed to explicit links.
* Fix: refactoring of links to wiki pages, from files nested below root directory would leave the physical wiki home
  directory instead of changing it to `wiki` as required to resolve on GitHub.
* Fix: refactoring explicit to wiki link would leave the markdown extension in the wiki. Extensions are now left only if
  target is not a markdown file.
* New: raw/blob preservation across wiki/main repo boundary during file move. Best attempt is made to preserve raw file
  access of original link
* New: intention actions implemented instead of annotation quick fixes. Same functionality but no unnecessary weak
  warnings just to have the quick fix showing and now they can be disabled individually if you don't need them.

  dialog.

  next element from being interpreted as the reference key for the newly inserted element.

* Fix: #135, references to files with image extension now only offer to convert to raw target URL

  fix to retarget reference

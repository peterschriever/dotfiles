T 1484814080 18<27sawk18>	hello everyone
T 1484814080 18<28M4dH4TT3r218>	How do I check that
T 1484814080 18<19darxmurf18>	dpkg -l | grep nvidia
T 1484814080 18<29dpkg18>	No packages found matching | grep nvidia
T 1484814080 18<27sawk18>	does someone experimented random freeze with debian stretch and intel graphics drivers? I have a Thinkpad T410 that is working fine on Debian Jessie, but it's having freeze (then reboot) in stretch
T 1484814080 18<26mad_hatter18>	so I downloaded the firmware netinst ISO, and I don't get the firmware errors anymore, but it fails to configure my network still with the error 'your network is probably not using DHCP protocol'
T 1484814080 18<19darxmurf18>	M4dH4TT3r2: on nvidia website they propose the 375.26
T 1484814080 18<24towo^work18>	sawk, apt purge xserver-xorg-video-intel
T 1484814080 18<27sawk18>	towo^work, I'm using wayland. Is that working anyway?

T 1484814080 18<26mad_hatter18>	any ideas what could be going on?
T 1484814080 18<19darxmurf18>	which debian version are you running ?
T 1484814080 18<28M4dH4TT3r218>	Yeah that was first one I tried darxmurf
T 1484814080 18<28M4dH4TT3r218>	Jessie 8
T 1484814080 18<19darxmurf18>	you could install it without problem ?
T 1484814080 18<19darxmurf18>	(the driver)
T 1484814080 18<28M4dH4TT3r218>	Yeah but reboot brought me to same place I am now
T 1484814080 18<19darxmurf18>	I would anyway remove and clean the actual driver and X configuration, install the nvidia one and recreate a xorg.conf (it will ask you in the end of the installation)
T 1484814080 18<19darxmurf18>	then reboot and see
T 1484814080 18<19darxmurf18>	in you startx picture it says "no screen found" which is also a bit weird
T 1484814080 18<28M4dH4TT3r218>	Ya
T 1484814080 18<28M4dH4TT3r218>	I have done what u mentioned there a few times
T 1484814080 18<24towo^work18>	sawk, yes, it would
T 1484814080 18<24towo^work18>	sawk, since even modesetting supports wayland
T 1484814080 18<19davidbo18>	Hi, my asrock eth0 isn't working, but i found a ubuntu workout. I should add the line "exec rmmod forcedeth" at next line of "script" in the file /etc/init/module-init-tools.conf. But debian jessie doesn't seem to have it. Where should i place this line?
T 1484814080 18<27sawk18>	ok thank towo^work
T 1484814080 18<27sawk18>	towo^work, i'm going to try...
T 1484814080 18<26missmbob18>	davidbo: you can just create that file
T 1484814080 18<19davidbo18>	missmbob, I'll try that.
T 1484814080 18<27DexterF18>	missmbob: duuuh... I mistyped #!/bin/bash without the ! and it just parsed it but did not interpret the bash, so it did not source the config file because source is a bash builtin. I spent days on that :D
T 1484814080 18<27laapstor18>	hello can you tell me how to identify sub domain from a tdl or how does the dns protocol identifies it. For example we have to two subdomains ba.co.google.com how does it know that co isn't a domain but a subdomain ??????

T 1482321193 18<22folatt18>	And I can vaguely recall that with Ubuntu, the luks partition was an extended partition, so I'm hesitating whether I should choose primary or extended.
T 1482321193 18<22folatt18>	I'm installing Arch now, Ubuntu did this whole thing for me.
T 1482321193 18<20alankila18>	Use GPT and there's no such thing as primary or extended
T 1482321193 18<22folatt18>	So for GPT it doesn't matter?
T 1482321193 18<20alankila18>	I don't think it really matters for linux either. The primary-extended thing is some ancient compatibility thing dating back from like DOS
T 1482321193 18<22folatt18>	That means I should choose "primary ext2" as that's the default although it really doesn't matter.

T 1482321193 18<20alankila18>	the key benefit is that with DOS partition tables you can get more than 4 partitions by embedding another partition table within a partition

T 1482321193 18<20alankila18>	With modern computers, you have GPT tables which support, was it, 16 partitions out of the box, or was it 128, I don't remember, and there's no need to put a boot block into the first partition either as the system firmware is capable of reading boot files off a VFAT filesystem called ESP

T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	Thanks for the intro
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	How I do my work currently is
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	I edit locally, and then push to dev server via sftp (previously filezilla)
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	than*
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	so it's tedious because every single line change, I have to do a upload
T 1482333114 18<28baum18>	PickAndMix: ah, that might not change your workflow too much
T 1482333114 18<28baum18>	PickAndMix: why not just ssh on the machine and edit the file there?
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	I'm working in a startup, and there's a few other developers working in the same server
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	So we follow the gitflow concept actually. The dev server is just there for us to test our code.
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	Do you have any thoughts on how I could improve my workflow?
T 1482333114 18<28baum18>	PickAndMix: uhm, then we are you using ftp instead of git to roll out your changes?
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	I have to test my code. So I need the dev server to test out.
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	I can't test locally.
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	Git is used to store my own feature branch
T 1482333114 18<28baum18>	PickAndMix: which stack are you using?
T 1482333114 18<28FedgeNo18>	ah so once your testing is done you actually push the git changes to your team
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	Yeah
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	We have production and dev server.
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	I'm hoping to start using tools like docker
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	baum: Flask, MySQL
T 1482333114 18<28baum18>	PickAndMix: uhm, yep, going with docker sounds good
T 1482333114 18<28FedgeNo18>	well since you have version control and probably multiple copies, you might as well just use sshfs. if you hose a file you can revert your changes. then you can just treat them like local files. that's really bad advice but it's way faster
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	But it going to take some time. There's so much things to do. This isn't a priority right now as we have to push stuffs out instead of working on internal tools.
T 1482333114 18<26jim18>	you should probably find somewhere to push the feature branch
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	FedgeNo: I used sshfs previously
T 1482333114 18<28FedgeNo18>	one thing that sucks is gnome shell sometimes freezes if the connection drops
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	Is this a common way of developing though?
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	I ain't a good dev, and it would be nice to find a way to improve our workflow
T 1482333114 18<28FedgeNo18>	i don't think most sysadmins would approve of you mounting their server as a subdirectory of your own machine. maybe under a user account that had limited access to the server but not as root
T 1482333114 18<28baum18>	PickAndMix: well you already know how to improve your workflow -> docker
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	baum: Alright! Look's like I'm on the right path then.
T 1482333114 18<28FedgeNo18>	so my method is probably not common for people who work for someone else
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	FedgeNo: Not really. I used your method before.
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	Just that I think currently doing locally is way neater and efficient as compared to editing right on the dev machine.
T 1482333114 18<26jim18>	PickAndMix, that's not quite specific enough... if you're not a good dev, what makes you that way, and what says you're that way? also, what are the consequences of that, which would inform what you're asking for here and now?
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	It feels cleaner, and I commit my code very often.
T 1482333114 18<26jim18>	which is a good thing
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	Yeah but I feel very amateur. I previously love to jump right in and start coding. As compared to my CEO, he does things really smartly. Spend so much time thinking/designing instead.
T 1482333114 18<28FedgeNo18>	has that planning stage greatly reduced the amount of refactoring and bugfixing you need to do near the middle/end of a project?
T 1482333114 18<26jim18>	PickAndMix, was the ceo who hired you?
T 1482333114 18<19jmd18>	After I have re-partitioned  the disk, how do I inform the kernel that the partition table has changed?
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	jmd: CTO
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	my CEO does everything LOL.
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	From sales to customer service to coding.
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	FedgeNo: Yeah
T 1482333114 18<26jim18>	and you're working on the same project he is?
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	Yup
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	He's currently working on the frontned
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	I'm working on the backend, building RESTful APIs
T 1482333114 18<26jim18>	so then, he's probably watching your commits?
T 1482333114 18<28baum18>	PickAndMix: once again: docker, now!
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	Not really
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	baum: !!! Yeah!@
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	I have 1 week off next week. Last week of the year
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	I'm going to take up some time to learn Docker.
T 1482333114 18<19jmd18>	PickAndMix: CTO: command not found
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	:P
T 1482333114 18<26jim18>	how does code review happen?
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	Yeah
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	I work with the Dev team more
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	So there's always code review.
T 1482333114 18<28baum18>	PickAndMix: oh and: https://github.com/diepm/vim-rest-console
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	My code are horrible
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	Holy shit. bookmarked.
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	But I'm glad I'm influencing the team into the VIM/TMUX CLI culture.
T 1482333114 18<28baum18>	stuff like that should end up in your vimrc, not the bookmarks :P
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	I'm like hardcore terminal guy :D
T 1482333114 18<26PickAndMix18>	:P Sorry, am fixing one bug right now.
T 1482333114 18<26jim18>	do you think that's useful?
T 1482333114 18<28FedgeNo18>	well sounds like you're on your way to being what you consider a good dev anyway so there you go
T 1482333114 18<28baum18>	PickAndMix: and since you go full-cli, mabybe checkout the wonderful world of tiling wm's

T 1482333114 18<26MrElendig18>	in which cause use cp, not ln
T 1482333114 18<20Ubuntulove18>	Its a updated mint
T 1482333114 18<26MrElendig18>	(also use openvpn instead :p)
T 1482333114 18<20Ubuntulove18>	hmm
T 1482333114 18<26MrElendig18>	mint is famous for having old versions
T 1482333114 18<20Ubuntulove18>	Well i just really need to have this done fast and i am so close to it all I need is to start it on boot
T 1482333114 18<20Ubuntulove18>	But im looking at the system edit
T 1482333114 18<24Duality18>	DLange: i am unable to find the option under the menu item kernelhacking
T 1482333114 18<20Ubuntulove18>	So what you suggest is I delete the link between my /etc/ and /lib/ service MrElendig and create a new link using systemctl edit?
T 1482333114 18<26MrElendig18>	Ubuntulove: do mint ship with a atuossh.service at all?
T 1482333114 18<26MrElendig18>	yes delete whatever you made
T 1482333114 18<20Ubuntulove18>	Well I think the guide is not actually using autossh but its creating autossh
T 1482333114 18<20Ubuntulove18>	using normal ssh
T 1482333117 18<26MrElendig18>	it clearly is using autossh

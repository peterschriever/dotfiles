T 1484814080 18<20asteele18>	i would say within 1-2 days
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	asteele: I think I know what I did. By using a hasMany relationship, you can get a blocklist but it will only contain ids. So you need to use the belongsTo relationship to get the user from the id.
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	asteele: so it looks like this: http://laravel.io/bin/roNx1
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	Problem is, if you have 10 blocks... you have your query to get the 10 blocks, but you still need to query the user table to get the username so you're doing an additioanl 10 queries just to get that right?
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	Utils: Auth::user()->blocks()->with('target') will load target users in the same query
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	will try that. also whats the difference between: `Auth::user()->blocks` and `Auth::user()->blocks()` ?
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	->blocks() is the relation/query object, ->blocks is magic for ->blocks()->get()
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	which returns a collection
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	ahhhh okay.
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	blackwater: maybe you can explain what's going on here: http://laravel.io/bin/9v9MD both methods of receiving the blocklist well...
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	thelatter, with ->target, has duplicate queries.
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	Ifeel like there shouldn't be duplicate queries?
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	i dont know why you have duplicate queries
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	but obviously it did load both targets in the same query
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	I'll block a 3rd user and see if I have 3 queries of the same.
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	out of curiosity try adding more targets
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	yes
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	Oh I think I know what I've done.
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	In my code, I do this: `@if (Auth::user()->blocks->isEmpty())` as well
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	If I specified the updated query twice, would it be cached?
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	do blocks()->exists() rather than blocks->isEmpty
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	no
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	oh
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	if you're really trying to cut down, pass the query to the view from the controller
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	I also thought about that too
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	Nice, that works.
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	e.g. view('some.view.here', ['blocks' => $user->blocks()])
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	then in the view you do @if($blocks->exists()) ... @foreach($blocks->get() as $block) ...
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	yeah I know about passing data to the view ^^
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	->with should come in mega handy now though. Thank you very much!
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	should be 1 query for blocks and 1 query for targets assuming you loaded ->with('target')
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	personally if I'm going to display the results regardless, I do @if(count($blocks = $some->relation)) @foreach($blocks) ...
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	but that's just my personal preference
T 1484814080 18<28Utils18>	blackwater: does ->exists() return a boolean?
T 1484814080 18<24blackwater18>	yes

T 1484814080 18<20asteele18>	Malgorath imo though, its worth spending 15-30 mins googling and slimming down your phpstorm install if its acting 'heavy' for you, rather than switching ide's

T 1484814080 18<26sisve18>	Have you ever had a customer that said "I want my login page to look exactly like that other guy" so you can reuse the forms and pages?

T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	as long as it works efficiently
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	and it's all completely extendable
T 1484814080 18<20asteele18>	that seems like a very narrow problem to solve
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	you can overwrite any template in your custom sprinkle
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	you'd be surprised...
T 1484814080 18<26sisve18>	You could add a simple basic-auth middleware on those routes.
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	yeah
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	but then you need a way to manage users

T 1484814080 18<26sisve18>	But you're not targetting Laravel developers, right?
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	I don't want people to think that the'll be able to just plug in their ball of spaghetti code

T 1484814080 18<20asteele18>	and that is good, but im just trying to make you think about these things mostly :)  To think like a business, who is your market really? and how should you target them
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	the target market is amateur devs, and devs who are still stuck in the 00's
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	who tend to be working at smaller companies or solo
T 1484814080 18<20asteele18>	so you need to have a huge solid answer to: why would that market not just use laravel, or symfony?  what separates those people from the market you are targetting?
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	well, they could start with Laravel
T 1484814080 18<20asteele18>	are people using laravel really going to upgrade to your system? that seems like a huge stretch to me
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	but they're not going to see any value in reimplementing their spaghetti in Laravel
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	no, I'm not targeting current Laravel users
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	we don't even use the entire Laravel framework

T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	should probably bump that to 5.3, actually...
T 1484814080 18<26sisve18>	Laravel 5.3 requires PHP 5.6, so you can increase your required php version too.
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	yeah
T 1484814080 18<26sisve18>	Also, use "5.3.*" as requirement, not ^5.3
T 1484814080 18<26sisve18>	Laravel is not semver, and 5.4 is not 100% compatible with 5.3
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	yeah the composer docs weren't super-clear about that
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	5.5 is EOL so I shouldn't feel bad about bumping the min version to 5.6
T 1484814080 18<26sisve18>	PHP 5.5 that is.
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	but anyway asteele, maybe I should emphasize the "rapid prototype" aspect of it
T 1484814080 18<26sisve18>	Note that 5.6 is also out of active support and is currently only receiving security fixes.

T 1484814080 18<26sisve18>	alexweissman, then stop doing whatever you're doing. This will take huge amounts of your time, and Laravel is not an appropriate framework to be building products on.
T 1484814080 18<26debjit18>	well it will take some time but yah sure.....
T 1484814080 18<26sisve18>	alexweissman, every 6 months you get an upgrade with breaking changes, and the old version is no longer supported.
T 1484814080 18<26sisve18>	alexweissman, you cannot maintain a product on those conditions.
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	well, the alternative is to write my own ORM
T 1484814080 18<20alexweissman18>	and my own HTTP router

T 1484814080 18<20asteele18>	i just dont think there is any room for a 'framework' on top of laravel and symfony
T 1484814080 18<20asteele18>	both laravel and symfony make very litte money, i guess i am biased, i think of ways that you can be profitable and make money, not just general FOSS

T 1484814080 18<27jemaclus18>	but you seem convinced that Eloquent does something fundamentally different than the normal Query Builder, so I'm not going to spend a ton of time trying to explain why that's not the case, other than to say, well, that's not the case.

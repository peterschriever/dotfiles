T 1478635332 18<19cousteau18>	(the "weird thing" in this case is not really doing the signed overflow itself, but rather encouraging users to do it)
T 1478635332 18<19cousteau18>	as a side note, the compiler DOES warn you about the weird optimization if you enable -Wall (Warning level: normal)

T 1478635332 18<29pwillard18>	it will just create heat
T 1478635332 18<28frop18>	normal, as in SSR?
T 1478635332 18<29pwillard18>	SSR can create noise... but usually has embedded noise snubbing circuit
T 1478635332 18<19thinkt4nk18>	Chillum any particular resources you would recommend for people who want to mess with arduino who might like to learn a bit about electronics to help them along the way?
T 1478635332 18<28frop18>	MRC isn't mechanical, aka noise?
T 1478635332 18<28Chillum18>	thinkt4nk: the way I learned was by doing various tutorials, then looking up every term I saw like "pull-up" and "flyback"
T 1478635332 18<19thinkt4nk18>	cool, ok, thanks
T 1478635332 18<28frop18>	I guess that's what I will do....
T 1478635332 18<28Chillum18>	and also I asked a lot of questions here and in ##electronics
T 1478635332 18<28frop18>	waiting 11/11 to buy cheap from aliexpress :D
T 1478635332 18<28Chillum18>	and http://electronics.stackexchange.com has lots of good info
T 1478635332 18<28Chillum18>	you can ask questions there, but they have to be intelligent questions or they reject it
T 1478635332 18<28Chillum18>	ie you need to be specific
T 1478635332 18<28Chillum18>	and know what you don't know

T 1478635332 18<24GeDaMo18>	Power?
T 1478635332 18<28frop18>	right, stupid me
T 1478635332 18<24Apocx18>	maybe someone can enlighten me, because I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around it. I have this (greatly simplified) setup: http://i.imgur.com/9BgHlDG.png
T 1478635332 18<24Apocx18>	how can I measure the solar and battery voltages without frying things when, say, the load is off?
T 1478635332 18<24Apocx18>	figured I'd need a voltage divider to start
T 1478635332 18<24Apocx18>	which would feed into an ADC
T 1478635332 18<28frop18>	wow, a solarpowered UPS? :D
T 1478635332 18<24Apocx18>	the arduino in this case is actually a custom board I made that utilizes an atmega328 uC. I just want to be able to also monitor the solar/battery voltage levels. the atmega controls some motors/pumps
T 1478635332 18<24Apocx18>	I just don't know if, say, having positive voltage on the ADC pin while the uC is not powered will fry it
T 1478635332 18<24Apocx18>	I'd probably actually use a dedicated ADC chip though

T 1478635733 18<28Snert_18>	the adc just loses input.
T 1478635761 18<28Snert_18>	or the arduino, whichever loses power.
T 1478635768 18<24Apocx18>	that's what I was hoping. I'll check out some ADC chip datasheets and see what it says.
T 1478635791 18<24Apocx18>	cause the charge controller will turn the load off if the levels get too low, but until that point I want to measure the voltages and log them over wifi
T 1478635798 18<28Snert_18>	most that could happen is the pin goes high instead of low....the arduino would just see a high.
T 1478635849 18<28Snert_18>	a steady high might mess up the program and crash it but no physical damage done is my bet.

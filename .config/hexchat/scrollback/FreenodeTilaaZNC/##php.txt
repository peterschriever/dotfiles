So for example a service that handles the system's billing capabilities is an independent, self-contained, service reachable by other parts of the system. This could mean everything from your database to your runtime environment are collectively a service.

T 1482333114 18<27googleguy18>	nindustries, The Microservices architecture conceives of an entire service that can be self-contained around a single capability of the system. So for example a service that handles the system's billing capabilities is an independent, self-contained, service reachable by other parts of the system. This could mean everything from your database to your runtime environment are collectively a service.
T 1482333114 18<27googleguy18>	Nothing there restricts you from having a runtime that is comprised of multiple language runtimes either.
T 1482333114 18<27googleguy18>	As long as it's all self-contained, it's essentially viewed as a black box. You don't know how it works, you don't care. All you know is that you can give it input and get some expected output.
